# Setup

We think `Docodile` looks great by default, and hopefully you think so too. A core design priniciple of `Docodile` is minimal config, preferring excellent defaults over complex config files and plugins. But there are obviously times where you will want to customise to fit your needs.

The most effective way to make your site your own is to change the colors and font. Consult the [appearance](./appearance.md) section to preview the different style options.

!!! question "Found an awesome look?"

    Post your config to the GitHub and it might be featured in our example screenshots!

## Advanced customisation

When you initialise a `Docodile` project you'll notice that all CSS files and HTML templates are available to you right there in your repo.

## What next?

Once your site is set up and looking great it's time to start creating content. Consult the [Reference](/reference/index.md) section to learn more.
