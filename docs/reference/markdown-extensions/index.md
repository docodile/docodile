# Markdown extensions

Beyond the basics, `gendoc` supports more advanced Markdown syntax. Many you will have seen in other Markdown processors, like [Admonitions](./admonitions.md) and [Tables](./tables.md) which are supported by most major static site generators. 

Some extensions in `gendoc` are not necessarily available in other Markdown processors and therefore might not work in both.
