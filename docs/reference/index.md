Now that you're set up you need to start writing some docs! This section will walk you through creating content on a `Docodile` site. If you're already familiar with Markdown you can skip [that section](./markdown.md), but make sure to check out the [Markdown Extensions](./markdown-extensions/index.md) section to learn about the advanced Markdown syntax that `Docodile` supports. 

The [organisation](./organisation.md) section will give tips on how to organise your documentation.
