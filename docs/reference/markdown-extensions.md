Because of the way tables are styled you can also use single-row tables to write in columns:

| to be, or not to be, thats the question To prick the sides of my intent, but only To entertain these fair well-spoken days, Devour up my discourse which I observing, How oft when men are at the point of death | I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, And portance in my travels' history And thus the native hue of resolution And that so lamely and unfashionable This vault a feasting presence full of light. |
