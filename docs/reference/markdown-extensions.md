## Tables

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |

```markdown
| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
```

Because of the way tables are styled you can also use single-row tables to write in columns:

| This is some text on the left colum. | This is some text in the right column. |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| This is some text on the left colum. |                                        |
| This is some text on the left colum. | This is some text in the right column. |
