# Contributing

Docodile is an open source project, the code is available for anyone to copy, modify and share. You can raise PRs on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/docodile/docodile/pulls) or [open an issue](https://github.com/docodile/docodile/issues) if you come across a bug or think of a feature you'd like to see implemented.

The following section broadly describes the current priorities of the project and how you can most meaningfully contribute to its development.

## Testing

The best thing you can do to help right now is use Docodile and [raise an issue](https://github.com/docodile/docodile/issues) if you run into any problems. Docodile has only been tested on Linux so far so feedback from Mac OS and Windows users is greatly appreciated. You will almost certainly run into issues trying to build from source, so understanding what is not cross-platform would be very helpful. 

## Pull requests

If you see something you think can be improved, no matter what it is, a pull request is always appreciated.

## Themes and stying

Docodile is largely inspired by [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) but it would be great if it had more of its own identity. Any experts in UX and/or CSS are welcome to submit ideas for how Docodile should look. We would also like to build a collection of themes that the user can choose from.
